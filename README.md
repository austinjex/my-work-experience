My boss, Todd Munford, said the following of me in a letter of recommendation: "He is excellent at managing customer expectations and is very fluent in his response to customer inquiries. He is one of the best listeners I have ever had work for me... Austin is a joy to work with because of his amazing, positive attitude and eagerness to learn. He consistently looks for ways to improve his product knowledge and job skills." One anonymous coworker at Progress said, "Austin is super friendly and is doing a great job working customer service. He is always so cheery and happy to be here. Also, he is good at remembering names." One of our receptionists said, "Austin is the go-to guy to send the customer service voicemails to in the mornings. He is so kind and always answers calls we send over to him!" A manager said, "I had a customer go out of his way to contact me as Austin’s manager to let me know what an outstanding job he did with a difficult customer situation. Fed Ex banged up customer’s order and Austin stayed calm and stayed the course with the customer to make sure he got taken care of." One customer emailed in after I helped him out on the phone and said, "I called FastWay customer service and the person was extremely friendly and gave me a solution to fix the problem. Outstanding customer service!!! His answer saved our weekend. I wanted you to know."<br><br></p>

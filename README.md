He is one of the best listeners I have ever had work for me... Austin is a joy to work with because of his amazing, positive attitude and eagerness to learn. He consistently looks for ways to improve his product knowledge and job skills." One anonymous coworker at Progress said, "Austin is super friendly and is doing a great job working customer service. He is always so cheery and happy to be here. Also, he is good at remembering names." One of our receptionists said, "Austin is the go-to guy to send the customer service voicemails to in the mornings. He is so kind and always answers calls we send over to him!" A manager said, "I had a customer go out of his way to contact me as Austin’s manager to let me know what an outstanding job he did with a difficult customer situation. Fed Ex banged up customer’s order and Austin stayed calm and stayed the course with the customer to make sure he got taken care of." One customer emailed in after I helped him out on the phone and said, "I called FastWay customer service and the person was extremely friendly and gave me a solution to fix the problem. Outstanding customer service!!! His answer saved our weekend. I wanted you to know."<br><br></p>

        <p style="font-size:130%;">I began my undergraduate degree in the biology major, a reflection of my love for physical sciences. After taking an introduction to psychology course, I discovered a new passion and pursued the psychology degree. I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to devote years to the study of psychology.
          I am grateful to have gained an education in a field that is so informative and diverse. During my studies, I gained a greater appreciation of the complexities and diversity, as well as universalities, of the human experience. I grew to love reading the academic literature, especially meta analyses on various topics. I learned new technical writing skills. I became skilled at statistics, as well as research design and analysis. I gained a deep understanding of the brain and the functions it orchestrates. I learned, above all, that I am capable of learning anything I put my mind to.<br><br></p>

           <p style="font-size:130%;">I am thankful to have received a high-quality well-rounded primary education. Aside from the required curriculum, I also elected to take 4 AP courses during high school (in biology, English, literature, and environmental science). I received a 4, 5, 4, and 5 on those AP tests respectively. During my high school education, I excelled in mathematics, English, and the physical sciences. My GPA in high school was 3.971. My transcript featured a single B, rightfully awarded for my performance in Geometry, a high school class I took during middle school. Earning that B taught me the valuable lesson that I can only learn as much as I'm willing to ask questions. I applied that lesson throughout the rest of my education by asking questions whenever I didn't understand something. Over time, I've come to believe that I can learn anything I want if I'm given enough time and if I ask questions and seek answers. <br><br>
          Aside from academics, I was quite busy with extracurriculars during high school. I attended a 1-hour morning study at my church every schoolday during all 4 years of high school. I also participated in cross country, swimming, soccer, and track & field. I was a competitive athlete and a leader on these teams. By the time I graduated, I had acheived my ambitious goal as a runner, which was to graduate with the school records in the 800 meter, 1600 meter, 3200 meter, and 5000 meter races. My time in high school helped me learn to set and acheive goals through hard work and discipline.</p>
